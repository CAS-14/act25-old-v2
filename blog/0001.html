  <h2>Post 0001: I accidentally deleted all my DNS records</h2>
  <p>by CAS</p>
  <p>
    As you (most likely) read from the title, today I accidentally deleted all
    my DNS records. Well, sort of. Essentially, my website is on www.act25.com
    and act25.com redirects to that. The way I got it to redirect was by
    having some extra DNS records with my domain provider. I got carried away
    changing the DNS records that I accidentally deleted a vital DNS record. I
    think it was the one that gave me access in the first place. I lost access
    to my website's DNS records and could not fix another mistake, so the site
    was down. A few hours later, it reappeared, and I could fix the DNS records.

    Thanks for reading my first "blog post." Again, IDK if this will become an
    actual thing on the website.
