    <h2>Dog News</h2>
    <p><span style="color: red;">Dogs are</span> being chased by the 'puppy packers' who want to keep them as pets. It's a little disappointing to them because they really feel like pets. They could give us treats or a bed of biscuits or something."</p>
    <p>Harrison says he's seen the pets in some other cities, including Berlin and Tokyo, but decided: "I want to give them some food and water â€¦ I feel like in cities there are very strict guidelines for where and when you feed them."</p>
    <p>In London, animal advocates are urging "humanitarian measures."</p>
    <p>"It doesn't help that there are people in the animal protection community in the city who are completely disgusted with dog behaviour," Harrison says. "People are appalled. It's so sad that we don't see them on the streets."</p>
    <p>Harrison says: "I want to make sure they're well cared for as human beings."</p>
    <h3>Commentary</h3>
    <p>This seems like a news article advising against having pets. Since when was that illegal? You can see that the style of the "article" is on point, but some things are off. "Bed of biscuits?" What does that even mean?</p>
