    <h2>Pig Stock Exchange</h2>
    <p><span style="color: red;">Donuts are very good, because</span> they're not as expensive as sugar. It's the most expensive food here," said Sam, who said he eats $11.50 per pound. He eats in a bowl with his dog, which often gets about $1.15 for the entire bowl.</p>
    <p>When the pigs were sold to the local grocery store in December, the prices jumped, but the number of bottles of the animals remained low.</p>
    <p>By the end of July, the amount of pigs that were selling for $2.25 an ounce had grown to $2,375 and the pigs got another $100 apiece, said Gary Hickey, a pork farmer in the city.</p>
    <p>"I mean, people don't go to market for something they don't need," Hickey said in an interview.</p>

    <p>Rats do not have to die of cancer to breed and must keep food healthy, Hickey said. But the meat does not always go to the veterinarian's office to be frozen and should be prepared under new conditions for their long-term safety.</p>

    <h3>Commentary</h3>
    <p>The AI took my topic (donuts) and ran with it. Pigs in bottles?! I laughed a lot because of the sheer nonsense of this story. It also seems that pigs are sort of a "stock exchange," their prices fluctuate at the market! The AI again treated this like an article, referencing an image that it did not provide. It also generated an actual address that exists in St. Paul, Minnesota. But I censored the address because it's a random house, not "Jack in the Box Supermarket."</p>
