    <h2>Eggnog Software</h2>
    <p><span style="color: red;">Eggnog</span> can be produced in 4.6 and up, while Snags & Glaces can be produced in 4.</p>
    <p>It is possible to produce Eggnog in two ways.</p>
    <p>1. Use Eggnog for a 1.4Gb file as opposed to 3GfG and the 1.7GfEgg-2.0.x file as it is possible to convert them from their standard output, however this will require having a 2.2g file, meaning there will be around 400,000 eggs left to supply the files required to run the 3GfEggnog on 3.3g of disk space.</p>
    <p>2. Use the Eggnog.exe to get the source files needed for the 3GfEggnog.</p>
    <p>It is also possible to use multiple ePATA files instead of one, for example to produce 3.9Gb or 4Gb files.</p>
    <p>This section does not seek to cover those issues I have encountered in using the 3GbEggnog method. However, the source file used in the procedure above will be the same as the 3.9GfEgg NGP file used to produce the 3.9Gb and 4Gb files. Thus making every EPGM file with this file set to this file type, even if it contains multiple ePATA files, would give the same results.</p>
    <h3>Commentary</h3>
    <p>Eggnog, the classic Christmas drink, can now be used as software for processing files. Wait, what?! When you give the generator a single word, it often gives a really odd output, which is exactly what happened here.</p>
